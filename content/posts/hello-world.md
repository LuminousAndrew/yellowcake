  I recently had the pleasure of taking an ATV tour with Potrero ATV Tours in
  Costa Rica, and it was an absolutely incredible experience. From start to
  finish, everything was top-notch, and I can't recommend this company highly
  enough.


  First off, the staff at Potrero ATV Tours were incredibly friendly and welcoming. They made sure that we were comfortable and had all of the information we needed before we set off on our tour. They also took the time to go over safety procedures and tips for riding ATVs, which made us feel very secure.


  The tour itself was absolutely amazing. We got to see some of the most beautiful landscapes in Costa Rica, from lush rainforests to stunning beaches. The trails were well-maintained and provided just the right amount of challenge, without ever feeling too dangerous or difficult. The ATV's were in great condition, too, so we felt safe and confident as we rode.


  One of the things I loved most about this tour was that it was so customizable. Our guide was happy to adjust the route based on our interests and preferences, which made the experience feel very personalized. We also had the option to add on additional activities, like swimming in a hidden waterfall or visiting a local village, which really enhanced the tour.


  Overall, I would highly recommend Potrero ATV Tours to anyone looking for an unforgettable adventure in Costa Rica. The staff, the trails, and the overall experience were all top-notch, and I can't wait to come back and do it all over again!
