  As a high school junior with a passion for coding, Andrew Balson was thrilled
  when his teacher returned from a recent trip to Costa Rica with news that the
  owner of Potrero ATV Tours needed a website. Andrew quickly jumped on the
  opportunity to gain real-world experience and put his coding skills to the
  test.


  The website creation process started with a meeting between Andrew and the owner of Potrero ATV Tours. They discussed the company's needs, goals, and vision for the website. Andrew took detailed notes and asked questions to ensure that he fully understood what the owner wanted.


  After the initial meeting, Andrew began working on the design of the website. He created several mockups and shared them with the owner for feedback. They worked together to refine the design until it met the owner's expectations and captured the essence of the Potrero ATV Tours brand.


  Once the design was finalized, Andrew began coding the website. He used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly, responsive website that looked great on any device. He also integrated features like online booking, photo galleries, and reviews to provide potential customers with a comprehensive overview of what they can expect on a tour with Potrero ATV Tours.


  Throughout the coding process, Andrew remained in constant communication with the owner, providing regular updates and getting feedback on each iteration. The owner was impressed by Andrew's attention to detail and his ability to translate their vision into a functional website.


  When the website was complete, Andrew provided the owner with a tutorial on how to manage the website, including how to update content, add new photos, and process online bookings. The owner was grateful for Andrew's dedication and the exceptional work he had done.


  Overall, the website creation process for Potrero ATV Tours was a great success. Andrew's passion for coding, attention to detail, and commitment to delivering the owner's vision resulted in a professional and user-friendly website that reflects the values and personality of the company. This real-world experience was an invaluable learning opportunity for Andrew and has helped him to gain the confidence and skills he needs to pursue a career in web development.
